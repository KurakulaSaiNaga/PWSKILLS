    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods\n",
    "from other classes. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and the hierarchical organization of classes. Inheritance enables the \n",
    "creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes), inheriting their \n",
    "properties while also adding new or modifying existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. It is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
