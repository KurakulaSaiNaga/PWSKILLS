    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management. Databases are designed to store and manage large volumes of data while providing mechanisms for data integrity, consistency, and security. They serve as a central repository for applications to store and retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases (Relational Databases):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**: SQL databases use a tabular, structured format to store data, organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each row in a table represents a record, and each column represents an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema**: SQL databases have a rigid, predefined schema that defines the structure, data types, and relationships between tables. Changes to the schema often require careful planning and migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Language**: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ACID Compliance**: SQL databases are known for their strong consistency and adherence to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transactions**: SQL databases support transactions, allowing multiple operations to be treated as a single, atomic unit. Transactions provide mechanisms for data integrity and recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scalability**: SQL databases can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) or horizontally (by sharding or replication). Horizontal scaling can be more complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Examples**: Popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph, to store data. The data structure is often more flexible and schema-less.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema**: NoSQL databases are typically schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing for more flexibility in adding or changing data attributes without requiring a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Language**: NoSQL databases use query languages specific to their data model. Examples include MongoDB's query language for document databases and Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for column-family databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency Models**: NoSQL databases offer a range of consistency models, from strong consistency to eventual consistency. The choice of consistency depends on the specific use case and trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Horizontal Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes. This is essential for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Flexibility**: NoSQL databases are well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data and can handle dynamic and evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Examples**: Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, Neo4j, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",

    "DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used for defining and managing the structure of a relational database. DDL statements are responsible for defining and managing database schema objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, and views. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete these objects, allowing database administrators and developers to define the database's structure and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations of four common DDL statements in SQL: CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. It defines the structure and characteristics of these objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Creating a new table named \"Customers\" with columns for customer information:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "       Age INT\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new table called \"Customers\" is created with columns for customer information. The PRIMARY KEY constraint is applied to the \"CustomerID\" column to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The DROP statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or constraints. It permanently deletes the specified object from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Dropping the \"Orders\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Orders;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This SQL statement deletes the \"Orders\" table, along with all its data and associated objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The ALTER statement is used to modify an existing database object's structure. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes in an existing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Adding a new column \"PhoneNumber\" to the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Customers\n",
    "   ADD PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new column \"PhoneNumber\" is added to the \"Customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table's structure intact. It is a fast way to delete all data from a table without removing the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Truncating the \"Logs\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Logs;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This statement removes all rows from the \"Logs\" table, leaving the table structure intact. It is more efficient than using DELETE for deleting all rows from a table.\n"

    "DML stands for \"Data Manipulation Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for manipulating data within a relational database. DML statements are responsible for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in database tables. They allow you to interact with the data stored in the database, making it possible to retrieve, modify, or remove records as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations of three common DML statements in SQL: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) into a table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into each column of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Inserting a new customer record into the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Age)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com', 30);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new customer record is added to the \"Customers\" table with values for each column. The values correspond to the customer's ID, first name, last name, email, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to specify which rows to update and the new values for one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Updating the email address of a customer with ID 1 in the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE Customers\n",
    "   SET Email = 'newemail@example.com'\n",
    "   WHERE CustomerID = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the email address of the customer with ID 1 is updated to a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table based on specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Deleting a customer record with ID 2 from the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Customers\n",
    "   WHERE CustomerID = 2;\n",

    "DQL stands for \"Data Query Language,\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and retrieving data from a relational database. DQL statements are primarily focused on the selection of data from one or more tables, enabling users to specify the criteria for retrieving specific records or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common DQL statement is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",

    "**Primary Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **primary key** is a column or set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row (record) in that table. It ensures that each row has a unique identifier, making it easy to distinguish one row from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The primary key must contain unique values for every row in the table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Primary keys are used as the basis for establishing relationships between tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Typically, primary keys are defined when a table is created, and they are often used as the target of foreign key constraints in related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Primary keys are crucial for data integrity, data indexing, and efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a \"Customers\" table with the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **foreign key** is a column or set of columns in one table that establishes a link or relationship with the primary key of another table. It is used to enforce referential integrity, ensuring that the data in the related tables remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The foreign key column in one table contains values that correspond to the values in the primary key column of another table. This linkage creates a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Foreign keys are used to maintain data consistency by preventing actions that would result in orphaned or inconsistent data. For example, they can prevent the deletion of a parent record if there are child records associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Foreign keys are often used to define relationships between tables in a database schema, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.\n",

    "6. **ORDER BY**: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It can specify the sorting order (ascending or descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **LIMIT/OFFSET (Optional)**: The LIMIT clause specifies the maximum number of rows to return, while the OFFSET clause allows skipping a certain number of rows from the beginning of the result set. These clauses are often used for pagination or limiting the result set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT (Optional)**: These set operations can be used to combine or compare the results of multiple SELECT queries.\n",
