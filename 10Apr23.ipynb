    "### Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Results**:\n",
    "   - The performance of each classifier is printed out in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which variant performed the best and why**:\n",
    "   - Based on the specific dataset, one variant might perform better than others due to the nature of the data.\n",
    "   - For instance, if the dataset contains binary features, Bernoulli Naive Bayes might perform better.\n",
    "   - If the dataset contains term frequencies, Multinomial Naive Bayes might be more suitable.\n",
    "   - Gaussian Naive Bayes is ideal for normally distributed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limitations of Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Independence Assumption**: Assumes that features are independent, which is rarely true in real-world data.\n",
    "   - **Zero Probability**: If a feature value was not present in the training data, the model assigns zero probability. Laplace smoothing is often used to mitigate this.\n",
    "   - **Sensitivity to irrelevant features**: The model can be sensitive to irrelevant features, impacting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summary**:\n",
    "   - Different variants of Naive Bayes classifiers were evaluated on the Spambase dataset.\n",
    "   - The performance metrics for each variant (Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Gaussian) were reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Future Work**:\n",
    "   - Further tuning of hyperparameters for each Naive Bayes variant.\n",
    "   - Feature engineering to improve the quality of input features.\n",
    "   - Consideration of other models that can capture dependencies between features (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).\n"
