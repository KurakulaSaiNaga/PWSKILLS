    "  *Precision* = TP/{TP + FP}\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Context:** Precision answers the question, \"Of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\" High precision indicates a low rate of false positives.\n",

    "**F1 Score:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.\n",
    "- **Formula:** \n",
    "  \n",
    "   *F1* = 2 . {Precision.Recall}/{Precision + Recall}  \n",

    "- **Difference from Precision and Recall:**\n",
    "  - Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
    "  - Recall measures the ability to find all positive instances.\n",
    "  - The F1 score balances precision and recall, making it useful when you need to account for both false positives and false negatives.\n",

    "**ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** A graphical representation of a classifier's performance across various thresholds.\n",

    "**AUC (Area Under the Curve):**\n",
    "- **Definition:** A single scalar value that summarizes the ROC curve.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - AUC = 0.5: Model performs no better than random chance.\n",
    "  - AUC = 1.0: Perfect model.\n",
    "  - The higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between positive and negative classes.\n",

    "**Choosing the Best Metric:**\n",
    "- **Considerations:**\n",
    "  - **Class Imbalance:** Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score are more informative than accuracy.\n",
    "  - **Cost of Errors:** Depending on the problem, you may prioritize reducing false positives (high precision) or false negatives (high recall).\n",
    "  - **Overall Performance:** AUC-ROC provides a holistic view of the model's performance across all thresholds.\n",
    "- **Context-Specific:**\n",
    "  - In spam detection, precision might be more important.\n",
    "  - In medical diagnosis, recall might be prioritized to ensure all cases are detected.\n",

    "**Multiclass Classification:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Involves predicting one label from three or more possible classes.\n",
    "- **Example:** Classifying images into categories like cats, dogs, and birds.\n",
    "- **Difference from Binary Classification:**\n",
    "  - Binary classification involves two classes (e.g., positive and negative).\n",
    "  - Multiclass classification involves more than two classes and requires different evaluation metrics and techniques (e.g., One-vs-Rest, One-vs-One).\n",
    "\n",

    "**Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification:**\n",
    "- **One-vs-Rest (OvR):** Train a binary classifier for each class against all other classes.\n",
    "  - **Process:** Each classifier outputs the probability of its respective class, and the class with the highest probability is chosen.\n",
    "- **Softmax Regression:** Extends logistic regression by computing probabilities for all classes simultaneously using the softmax function.\n",
    "  - **Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   *P(y=i|x)*=e^((β_i)^T * x)/∑(j=1 to K)(e^(β_j)^T *x)\n",
